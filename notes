Schema syncing:

Server: Generate a schema automagically based on packets' most used pieces of data
Server: Send packet schema to clients
Server: Cache current packet schema hash
Client: Upon recieving packet schema cache it and hash it, then cache the hash as well
Client: In future connections, send schema hash with connection information, if nothing
        has changed the hash will be the same and the schema will not need to be synced again
